/*
Java provides many different methods for getting user input.
The Scanner object is the most common, and perhaps the easiest to implement. 
*/

//Import the Scanner class to use the Scanner object, as seen here:
import java.util.Scanner; 


//In order to use the Scanner class, create an instance of the class by using the following syntax:
Scanner myVar = new Scanner(System.in);

/*
You can now read in different kinds of input data that the user enters.
Here are some methods that are available through the Scanner class:
Read a byte - nextByte()
Read a short - nextShort()
Read an int - nextInt()
Read a long - nextLong()
Read a float - nextFloat()
Read a double - nextDouble()
Read a boolean - nextBoolean()
Read a complete line - nextLine()
Read a word - next()
*/


//Example of a program used to get user input:
import java.util.Scanner;

class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    Scanner myVar = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println(myVar.nextLine());        
  }
}
