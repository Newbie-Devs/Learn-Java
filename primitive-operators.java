//Java provides a rich set of operators to use in manipulating variables
//A value used on either side of an operator is called an operand
int x = 6 + 3;
//In this expression, 6 and 3 are operands of the plus operator
/* Java arithmetic operators are:
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
% modulo */
/* Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same
way  that they are used in algebric equations */

/* The + operator adds together two values, such as two constants,
a constant and a variable, or two variables */
int sum1 = 50 + 10;
//In this example sum1 will store the result of the sum
int sum2 = sum1 + 66;
//In this case we add 66 to the variable sum1
int sum3 = sum1 + sum2;
//In this example we add two wariables

//The - operator subtracts one value to an another
int sut1 = 1000 - 10;
//In this example, sut1 will store the result of the subtraction
int sut2 = sut1 - 50;
//In this case, we subtract 50 to the variable sut1
int sut3 = sut1 - sut2;
//In this example, we subtract the variable sut2 to the variable sut1
/*Just like in algebra, you can use both of the operations in
a single line */
int pro = 10 + 5 - 2;

//The * operator multiplies two values.
int mult1 = 1000 * 2;
//In this example mult1 will store the result of the multiplication
int mult2 = mult1 * 10;
//In this case we multiplicate 10 for the variable mult1
int mult3 = mult1 + mult2;
//In this example we multiplicate two wariables

//The / operator divides one value by another
int div1 = 1000 / 10;

int div2 = div1 / 2;

int div3 = div1 / div2;
//In this example we divide one variable by another one
