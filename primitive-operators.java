//Java provides a rich set of operators to use in manipulating variables
//A value used on either side of an operator is called an operand
int x = 6 + 3;
//In this expression, 6 and 3 are operands of the plus operator
/* Java arithmetic operators are:
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
% modulo */
/* Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the same
way  that they are used in algebric equations */
/* The + operator adds together two values, such as two constants,
a constant and a variable, or two variables */
