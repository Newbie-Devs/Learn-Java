//variables store data for processing;
//a variable is given a name (or identifier) such as area or age;
//the name uniquely identifies each variable, assigning a value to the variable and retrieving the value stored;  

//Variables have types:
//int (integer, whole numbers ), this value is a number without decimals
//double, for floating-point or real numbers with optional decimal points and fractional parts in fixed or scientific notations, such as 3.12 or -55.66
//char (stands for character), holds only a single character. 
//string, this value is made out of multiple chars which forms a line of text. 
String name = "David";
//this creates a variable called name of type string and assigns it the value "David"
//bool (stands for boolean), this value can be only true or false. This data type is used for simple flags that track true/false conditions. 
//all this value types must be written in the variable initialization ahead of the varable's name

//examples of variable declarations:
class Solar {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String name ="David";
    int age = 18;
    double score = 15.9;
    char group = "Z";
    boolean online = true;
    }
  }
/* you can use a comma-separated list to declare
  more than one variable of the specified type */
int a = 42, b = 23;
